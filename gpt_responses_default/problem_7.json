Return only the raw code for the Python program, ensuring it's functional and follows Python best practices. Verify the program's correctness as if using a Command Line Interface. Use the following keywords to solve a problem with Python: Concurrency. Remember to only respond with the raw code for the Python program. Generate a Python program that uses a list and return only the raw code. If you have explanations or comments, include them in the code as comments.\n",
